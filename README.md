# Project-Fake-Instagram-Profile-Dectection-Using-Deep-Learning

Using Python, we build a multi layer neural network with the ideal loss and activation functions. Exploratory data analysis using libraries such as numpy, seaborn, pandas and sci-kit. Assess the performance of the trained model. Calculate and analyse to see if it's overfitting or underfitting. Finally, come up with a confusion matrix.
